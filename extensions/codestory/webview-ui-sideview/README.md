# `webview-ui` Directory

This directory contains all of the code that will be executed within the webview context. It can be thought of as the place where all the "frontend" code of a webview is contained.

Types of content that can be contained here:

- Frontend framework code (i.e. React, Svelte, Vue, etc.)
- JavaScript files
- CSS files
- Assets / resources (i.e. images, illustrations, etc.)


### Super important
- Please build this before doing anything else
- If you dont build this independently of the rest of the things you will have a stale version of the extension
